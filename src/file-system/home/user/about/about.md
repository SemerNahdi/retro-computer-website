# Hi there

My name is Semer Nahdi, I’m a Big Data and AI Engineering student and full-stack developer passionate about building intelligent systems. My work spans AI-powered applications, web development, and data-driven solutions — blending creativity, technology, and innovation to design impactful digital experiences.

In addition to my love of technology and design, I am also interested in education, history, economics and politics.

Type "cd ~/projects" then "ls" to see details of some of the projects I have developed over years of coding experience.
